# VRpaint

VRpaint is a fork of Google's Tilt Brush

I made this so you can download Tilt Brush without having to build it yourself

I renamed it to "VRpaint" because otherwise i get problem with copyright stuff

The Tilt Brush trademark and logo (“Tilt Brush Trademarks”) are trademarks of
Google

i also dont know how to write markdown and how to use Github and how to english
